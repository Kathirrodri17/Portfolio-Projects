# EPL Match Winner Prediction for 2024-25 Season

## Project Overview

This Project aims to predict the winners of English Premier League (EPL) matches for the 2024-25 season. Utilizing historical data from the 2022-2024 seasons, a prediction model was built to forecast match outcomes with a focus on accuracy.

## Data Scrapping
The Project required realtime match data from the English Premier League and so data scraping became an important part of this project   
The data was scraped from FBref using Beautiful Soup and extracted from HTML. The dataset encompasses various performance metrics and statistics from the previous two EPL seasons.


## Data Processing

1. **Data Collection:** Historical match data (2022-2024) was collected using Beautiful Soup and Pandas.
2. **Data Cleaning:** The raw data was cleaned and pre-processed with Pandas to ensure consistency and accuracy for modeling.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Additional predictor variables were introduced to enhance the model's performance.

## Model Building

The prediction model was developed using Scikit-Learn with the following classifiers:
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Random Forest Classifier**

Initially, the model achieved an accuracy of 60% in predicting match outcomes, with a specific winner prediction accuracy of 47%.

## Model Improvement

To improve the prediction of specific match winners, the following steps were undertaken:
1. **Error Analysis:** Measurement of model errors to identify areas for improvement.
2. **Data Enhancement:** Further cleaning and addition of new predictor variables.
3. **Model Refinement:** Adjustments to the model to boost performance.

After these improvements, the model's accuracy in predicting specific match winners increased to 60%.

## Results

- **Overall Match Outcome Prediction Accuracy:** 60%
- **Specific Match Winner Prediction Accuracy:** 60%
- ## Future Work

- **Explore Additional Machine Learning Algorithms:** Investigate and apply different algorithms to potentially achieve better prediction accuracy.
- **Integrate More Detailed Player and Team Statistics:** Include more granular data to enhance the modelâ€™s ability to predict match outcomes.
- **Incorporate Real-Time Data Updates:** Implement mechanisms to update the data dynamically for more accurate and up-to-date predictions.
