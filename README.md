This project focuses on the exploratory data analysis (EDA) of COVID-19 data using SQL, Excel, and Tableau. The goal was to analyze the massive datasets from all countries, clean and prepare the data for visualization, and create a comprehensive dashboard to summarize the findings.

## Project Overview

### Tools and Technologies Used
- **SQL**: Microsoft SQL Server for initial data analysis and querying
- **Excel**: For data cleaning and preparation
- **Tableau**: For data visualization and dashboard creation

### Steps Involved

1. **Data Collection and Import**:
   - Imported a large dataset containing COVID-19 data from multiple countries into Microsoft SQL Server.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Performed initial analysis using SQL to understand the dataset's structure and key statistics.
   - Queried and filtered the data to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies.

3. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Exported the queried data to Excel for further cleaning.
   - Handled missing values, corrected inconsistencies, and formatted the data for analysis.

4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Imported the cleaned data into Tableau.
   - Created a dashboard to visualize key insights, including trends over time, geographical distribution, and comparisons between countries.

## Key Insights
- Summary of the most significant trends and findings from the data analysis.
- Visual representations of the impact of COVID-19 across different regions.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to data analysis, from SQL querying and data cleaning in Excel to advanced visualizations in Tableau. The resulting dashboard provides valuable insights into the global impact of COVID-19.
