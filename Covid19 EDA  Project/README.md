## Project Overview

This project focuses on the exploratory data analysis (EDA) of COVID-19 data, utilizing SQL, Excel, and Tableau. The goal was to analyze extensive datasets from multiple countries, clean and prepare the data for visualization, and create a comprehensive dashboard to summarize and communicate the findings.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **SQL:** Microsoft SQL Server for initial data analysis and querying.
- **Excel:** For data cleaning and preparation.
- **Tableau:** For data visualization and dashboard creation.

## Steps Involved

### Data Collection and Import

- Imported a large dataset containing COVID-19 data from multiple countries into Microsoft SQL Server.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Performed initial analysis using SQL to understand the dataset's structure, including key metrics such as case counts, mortality rates, and recovery rates.
- Queried and filtered the data to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies, such as spikes in cases, seasonal variations, and the impact of interventions.

### Data Cleaning

- Exported the queried data to Excel for further cleaning.
- Handled missing values, corrected inconsistencies, and formatted the data for accurate analysis.

### Data Visualization

- Imported the cleaned data into Tableau.
- Created an interactive dashboard to visualize key insights, including:
  - **Trends Over Time:** Trends in case numbers, deaths, and recoveries over the course of the pandemic.
  - **Geographical Distribution:** Maps showing the spread of COVID-19 across different regions and countries.
  - **Comparisons Between Countries:** Comparative analysis of case rates, death rates, and vaccination rates across various countries.

## Key Insights

- **Global Trends:** Identified significant waves of infection and variations in severity across different periods.
- **Regional Impact:** Visualized how the impact of COVID-19 varied between continents, countries, and regions, highlighting hotspots and areas with slower spread.
- **Mortality and Recovery Rates:** Analyzed and visualized the mortality and recovery rates, providing insights into healthcare impacts and recovery patterns.


## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a thorough approach to data analysis, from querying and initial exploration in SQL to data cleaning in Excel and advanced visualizations in Tableau. The resulting dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the global impact of COVID-19, offering valuable insights into the trends, geographical distribution, and effectiveness of different responses throughout the pandemic.
